# BSDPackHound
BSD package downloader, with proxy support

This program was initially written by Anton P. Kolosov in 2010.
It was designed to retrieve FreeBSD precompiled packages (*.tbz archives) with its dependencies, which can be later installed with pkg_add.
Unfortunately, it will not work with the current version of FreeBSD packages, only 8.4 release is supported for now.
That's it.
